Here is the beginning of an implementation of MiniJava Compiler, based on the book *Modern Compiler Implementation in Java, 2nd Edition*.
It was made in 2015 for a classroom project by [Raphaell Dyego](http://www.github.com/RDyego), [Lucas Eduardo](http://www.github.com/lucaseduardo101), DÃ©bora Monteiro and [me](http://www.github.com/paulobruno).

The code is incomplete and probably not functional, but it will be revised in the future.
